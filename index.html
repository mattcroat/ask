    <h1>How to Ask Questions</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Don't Ask to Ask a Question, Just Ask</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          <strong>‚ùå Bad</strong>: ‚ÄúDoes someone know <strong>React</strong>?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>‚úÖ Good</strong>: ‚ÄúHow can I apply a class in
          <strong>React</strong> on the element the user pressed?‚Äù
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Don't be afraid to ask</strong> because people who help do so
        because they want to.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Describe Your Problem</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          <strong>‚ùå Bad</strong>: ‚ÄúDoes someone know why
          <code>git push</code> doesn't work? (without context)‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>‚úÖ Good</strong>: ‚ÄúWhen I try doing <code>git push</code> here
          is the error message I get that I'm unable to resolve.‚Äù
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Avoid being vague.</strong> When asking for help answer
        <strong>‚ÄúWhat isn't working?‚Äù</strong> and
        <strong>‚ÄúWhat is the expected result?‚Äù</strong>. Describe the problem to
        the best of your ability.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Make Others Want to Help You</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>‚ùå Bad</strong>: ‚ÄúWhy doesn't this work?‚Äù</p>

        <p>
          <strong>‚úÖ Good</strong>: ‚ÄúExplain the problem you're facing and how
          you expect it to work alongside a recording, or reproduction of the
          problem.‚Äù
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Avoid mental gymnastics for everyone involved.</strong> The
        clearer you present your problem the easier it is for someone to help
        you.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a <strong>recording</strong>, or
          <strong>screenshot</strong> using
          <a href="https://www.screentogif.com/">ScreentToGif</a> (Windows),
          <a href="https://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> (macOS),
          <a href="https://github.com/phw/peek">Peek</a> (Linux), or use
          <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> to record video and
          sound
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a
          <strong>minimal reproduction of the problem</strong> (recreate the
          problem and not the entire project) using
          <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a> you can share with
          others
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're sharing code on <strong>Discord</strong> make sure to use
          <strong>code blocks</strong> by using three opening and closing
          <strong>backticks</strong> <code>`</code> alongside
          <strong>syntax higlighting</strong> (for example if you want to
          highlight <strong>JavaScript</strong> after the first three backticks
          specify <strong>js</strong> as the language)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Read Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Read and try to understand the documentation</strong> alongside
        watching a tutorial, so you catch any breaking changes and level up as a
        developer at the same time.
